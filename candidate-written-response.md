### Candidate written response

Hi Team ,

After Executing Succesfully the given Coding Test and checking criteria of acceptance, I feel there are few possibilty which can enhance current Enzyme testing suite :

a) We can implemnt Drag and Drop feature instead of right and left click.

b)We can implement Graph which shows number of existing assembly items in respective phases.

c)We can make UI more user friendly by making sure it does not break in mobile and tabs.

d) Once idea is removed from Assembly phase we can maintan bin type to just keep list of items which was
deleted intentionally or may be by mistake and to recover back to its phase.

e) Before We delete item from Idea we can ask user to provide necesarry details why we could not take idea to
developement phase or reason for rejection.

I made sure comments are given for functions with valid variable names following naming conventions.

I could have made it better, but due to timing constraint in current project and KT to my replacement i made sure its working as expected and Successfully excuted.
